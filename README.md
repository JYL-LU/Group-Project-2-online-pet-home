## Concept:

Dog Shelter Online  is a website which allows users to find homeless dogs in different shelters. Once users are registered and log in, they would be able to access our database with over hundreds of dogs online. What’s More  is that our service provides an opportunity which allows users to use our data information to physically locate the dogs. Later they can continue to interact with the dogs and other users by visiting our website, post/comment on their most up to date conditions, as well as exchanging information and having discussions.
